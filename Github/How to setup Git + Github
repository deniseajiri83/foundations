# HOW TO SET UP GIT AND GITHUB:
#Github is where all the coders store all their codes
#you need to install and set up git
#git is a version control system
#git is a dropbox or GoogleDocs for codes.
#Github is a cloud for codes.
#it's best just because you can share codes with others
#you set up a profile and put it there
#you make repositories (collection of your codes)
#they can be private/non-private
#for mac, run this code in your termina: brew install git
# It installs it permenantly
# there is a desktop version for git. DON'T USE IT. It'll crash all the time.
#Run this

#git config --global user.name "deniseajiri.83"
#git config --global user.email "denise.ajiri83@gmail.com"
