How to add things on Github:

1.git add . to add everything, or git add FILENAME to add files one by one.
2. git commit -m "Message here" to make a commit, a.k.a. save things into your repository
3. git push to send everything to GitHub - you’ll use git push -u origin master the first time

** IF YOU WANT TO ADD BY GIT ADD FILENAME... USE "TAB" TO WRITE THE REST OF THE NAME (IN ORDER NOT TO FORGET THE SPACES AND CHARACTES...IT WRITES IT AUTOMATICALLY..L LIKE TERMINAL USING TAB)

LEEAVE IT FOR NOW
4. Did it not work? Did you get a message about git pull? That means there is new data on the repository that isn’t on your computer. Running git pull by itself will sometimes send you into a weird text editor, hit ESCAPE then type :wq and hit enter. I know, it’s dumb. You could also run git pull --rebase to avoid that. Then try to commit and push again.

  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   .DS_Store
	new file:   05 - pandas (billionaires).ipynb
	new file:   Github/How to setup Git + Github

Denises-MacBook-Air:foundations Denise$ git rm .DS_Store
error: the following file has changes staged in the index:

(use --cached to keep the file, or -f to force removal)
Denises-MacBook-Air:foundations Denise$ git rm -f .DS_Store
